## Installation

Before installing the package, make sure you have installed [RN Skia](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/). 

```sh
yarn add @shopify/react-native-skia
```

Then, you can install the package:

```sh
yarn add react-native-qrcode-skia
```

## Usage

You might need a very simple QRCode component in your app and you can achieve that by using the basic props (value and size). Here is an example:

```tsx
import QRCode from 'react-native-qrcode-skia';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <QRCode
      value="https://patreon.com/reactiive"
      size={200}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

Under the hood, the QRCode is essentially a Skia Path. This means that customization is straightforward using the 'children' prop. Here's an example:

```tsx
import QRCode from 'react-native-qrcode-skia';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <QRCode
      value="https://patreon.com/reactiive"
      size={200}
      shapeOptions={{
        shape: "circle",
        eyePatternShape: "rounded",
        eyePatternGap: 0,
        gap: 0
      }}
      logoAreaSize={70}
      logo={
        <View style={{
          height: 50,
          aspectRatio: 1,
          justifyContent: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
        }}>
          <Text style={{ fontSize: 38 }}>ðŸ¦Š</Text>
        </View>
      }
    >
      <RadialGradient c={{ x: 100, y: 100 }} r={100} colors={["#eeca3b","#ee3b83"]} />
    </QRCode>
  );
};

export default App;
```
